    <div><h1>Afang Soup</h1></div>

    <div>
      <p>
        Afang soup is a tasty, nutritious Nigerian soup, native to the
        Efiks/Ibibios (Akwa Ibom & Cross river states). This delicious soup has
        a slight bitter taste and is usually prepared with a combination of
        vegetables (Afang leaves and water leaves), assorted seafood/fish, meat
        and spices .Afang soup is one of the richest and somewhat medicinal
        vegetable soups of the Efiks/Ibibios in Nigeria. The Igbosâ€™ have a
        similar soup known as Okazi soup. The only major difference is that a
        soup thickener is added to Okazi Soup to increase its
        viscosity(thickness), but afang soup gets its thickness from the bulk of
        vegetables used in preparing it. Some parts of Cameroon bordering that
        part of Nigeria also enjoy this delicacy.
